# ** Live Lecture Streaming System **
                                                                                 
## 📌 Project Overview:

   **This project aims to develop a real-time live streaming system for lectures in our college. The system will allow a lecturer in one classroom to broadcast the lecture to multiple other classrooms over LAN, 
    ensuring that no students are left idle when only one lecturer is available.**

  **The goal is to achieve low-latency streaming so that students in remote classrooms can experience the lecture as if they were physically present in the main class. If possible, the lecturer should also have 
    some level of control over the remote classrooms.**

## 🎯Features:
 -->**Live Streaming**: Real-time transmission of the lecture to multiple classrooms.      
 -->**LAN-Based Streaming**: Utilizes the college's internal network for smooth performance.
 -->**Multiple Viewers**: Supports multiple student devices or smart boards in classrooms.
 -->**Low Latency**: Ensures minimal delay for an interactive experience.
 -->**Lecturer Controls**: Possible interaction between lecturer and remote students.

## 🏆 Goals
 -->**Achieve a fully functional LAN-based live lecture streaming system.**
 -->**Maintain high-quality video with minimal latency.**
 -->**Ensure ease of use for lecturers and students.**
